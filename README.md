= Wireless Sensor Network Deployments (2013-2017) =
This is an open data repositiory.

It is concerned with systematically reviewing scientific publications containing actual Wireless Sensor Network deployments in five year span from 2013 to 2017.

== Identification ==
Articles were first searched for in SCOPUS and Web of Science databases on 2018-06-12 using these queries/settings:

=== SCOPUS ===

Query: KEY({sensor network} OR {sensor networks}) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY(test* OR experiment* OR deploy*) AND NOT TITLE-ABS-KEY(review) AND NOT TITLE-ABS-KEY(simulat*) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2017 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2016 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2015 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2014 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2013 ) ) 

Raw results: 11536 articles

De-duplicated results: 11374 articles

Contained 4814 articles not found in Web of Science
	
=== Web Of Science ===

Querry:	TS = ("sensor network" OR "sensor networks") AND TS = (test* OR experiment* OR deploy*) NOT TI="review" NOT TS=simulat*

Additional query parameters: Indexes=SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, BKCI-S, BKCI-SSH, ESCI, CCR-EXPANDED, IC Timespan=2013-2017

Raw results: 10204 articles

De-duplicated results: 10196

Contained 3636 articles not found in SCOPUS

=== Final results ===
When article results were merged from both databases finally 15010 articles were identified as possible candiates. Of those 6560 were found in both databases.
    
== Screening ==
Data was exported as bibtex files and imported in Mendeley software for screening.     

4910 articles were left after the screening phase

== Eligibility check ==
Then all screened included articles were checked for eligibility and 3017 eligible articles were identified.

== Data extraction ==
In these articles 3059 wireless sensor network deployments were identified and codified data extracted from them.

== Timeline ==
This data analysis took total time (including validation and error checking) from 2018-06-12 till 2020-05-29, after which the data was prepared for publiching till 2020-07-02.
